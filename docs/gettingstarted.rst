Getting started
===============

SUNBIRD provides routines to train neural-network-based models for galaxy clustering. It also incorporates
pre-trained models for different summary statistics, including:

- Galaxy two-point correlation function
- Density-split clustering statistics
- Void-galaxy cross-correlation function.

These models have been trained on mock galaxy catalogues based on the AbacusSummit simulations. The
models are described in detail in `this paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09089>`_.
